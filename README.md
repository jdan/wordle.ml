Cheating at [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) with OCaml.

### usage

Grab dependencies from [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org)

```sh
opam install dune ppx_inline_test
```

Modify the `rules` list in `bin/main.ml`. Then run:

```sh
cat words.txt | dune exec bin/main.exe | head
# upeat 71385
# cheat 69860
# theca 69860
# thema 68635
# wheat 65555
# tweag 64450
# tweak 63350
# theat 59228
# theta 59228
# theah 54996
```

These candidates are sorted by a very rough heuristic:
* For each letter, add the number of times that letter appears in any word
* Multiply by the number of unique letters (more letters means more clues!)

#### rules reference

Given a target string, the following rules are used as follows:

* `Exact (ch, idx)` - The character at index `idx` is equal to `ch`
* `Other (ch, idx)` - Character `ch` is found at an index not equal to `idx`
* `Never ch` - The character `ch` never appears in the string
* `AtLeast (ch, count)` - The character `ch` appears in the string at least `count` times

### results

It works okay! I cheated on day 197 starting with "SIREN"

### example

Let's image we have the word "CHEAT."

Set `rules` to `[]` and run:

```sh
cat words.txt | dune exec bin/main.exe | head
# arose 84745
# orate 84735
# arise 83645
# raise 83645
# serai 83645
# arite 83635
# irate 83635
# retia 83635
# tarie 83635
# ariel 83570
```

Manually computing this, "AROSE" would get a pattern of ğŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ¨. Modify `rules` accordingly and re-run:

```ocaml
let rules =
  [ Other ('a', 0)
  ; Never 'r'
  ; Never 'o'
  ; Never 's'
  ; Other ('e', 4)
  ]
```

```sh
cat words.txt | dune exec bin/main.exe | head
# laeti 80260
# entia 79490
# tenai 79490
# tinea 79490
# elain 79425
# linea 79425
# ental 78425
# laten 78425
# leant 78425
# ileac 76085
```

LATEN corresponds to a pattern of â¬›ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬›.

```ocaml
let rules =
  [ Other ('a', 0)
  ; Never 'r'
  ; Never 'o'
  ; Never 's'
  ; Other ('e', 4)

  ; Never 'l'
  ; Other ('a', 1)
  ; Exact ('e', 2)
  ; Other ('t', 3)
  ; Never 'i'
  ]
```

```sh
cat words.txt | dune exec bin/main.exe | head
# upeat 71385
# cheat 69860
# theca 69860
# thema 68635
# wheat 65555
# tweag 64450
# tweak 63350
# theat 59228
# theta 59228
# theah 54996
```

Though UPEAT is likely not in Wordle's dictionary, we'll run with it using a pattern of â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©.

```ocaml
let rules =
  [ Other ('a', 0)
  ; Never 'r'
  ; Never 'o'
  ; Never 's'
  ; Other ('e', 4)

  ; Never 'l'
  ; Other ('a', 1)
  ; Exact ('e', 2)
  ; Other ('t', 3)
  ; Never 'i'

  ; Never 'u'
  ; Never 'p'
  ; Exact ('e', 2)
  ; Exact ('a', 3)
  ; Exact ('t', 4)
  ]
```

```sh
cat words.txt | dune exec bin/main.exe | head
# cheat 69860
# wheat 65555
```

CHEAT wins out against WHEAT (C's are more common), giving us a successful solution.
